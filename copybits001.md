Jestin LeBaron Guess you could put it that way, we would say it is dictated more by higher math like calculus etc.

Mark Anthony Decubellis a region of space time where the laws of physics do not apply?

Mark Anthony Decubellis it's no wonder why so many doubt they even exist!

Jestin LeBaron Well yea the movie version of black holes is illogical, but it was our understanding that the majority of the scientific community just believes them to be collapsed stars, not a literal "hole" in space time.

Jestin LeBaron They aren't really, the size/mass and gravitational field of a star is massive and is generally thought to be able to bend light and therefore time. When a star collapses it still maintains it's mass and gravitational field, it just becomes the size of a baseball.

Mark Anthony Decubellis Well I agree that physics can explain it, but it seems that the gravitational field acts differently inside a black hole.

Jestin LeBaron We don't get what you mean by "inside". From our understanding, a singularity is a solid rock of the most dense matter imaginable. It still has the same gravity that it had as a large star, so all the light that passes by it is bent around and then sucked into the singularity.

Mark Anthony Decubellis it is a region of space time where the power of gravity does not allow anything to enter it including light.

Jestin LeBaron Oh yea the event horizon thing, not sure about that. Think they are still trying to figure that out because it falls into the "light and time" hypothesis they are working on. It's like Dr. Kaku said, when you look in a mirror you aren't seeing yourse...See More

Mark Anthony Decubellis Yeah I'm not really sure what to make of it., myself. Just posted this in response to an argument I heard that the universe was constructed by the laws of logic.

Mark Anthony Decubellis Do you realize that our universe is constructed by 'laws' some may call them blueprints. The material universe was made according to these laws or logic. That logic came logically before the material universe (time and space) began. It doesn't make sen...See More

Stephen Wilborne Yes, the universe is dictated by logic. However it is not the traditional kind of Aristotelian logic which we were trained from our youth and programmed into accepting as unambiguously and irrefutably valid.

The universe may be based on a non-classical logic, such as that associated with quantum information theory, but it is definitely not based on classical (Aristotelian) logic. That much is *absolutely* clear.

Jestin LeBaron Careful, if your logic be ambiguous you don't want to be the "boy that cried absolutely"

Stephen Wilborne // Careful, if your logic be ambiguous you don't want to be the "boy that cried absolutely" //

Brilliant observation, Jestin LeBaron. 

But that just underscores the issue here.

The universe is indeed governed by something other than an Aristotelian logic, but human brains (at least in this current society in which i find myself) are programmed into thinking that way.

Even the attempt to answer this question with a "yes or no answer" reveals the programming!

Thus, the mere act of answering this question presents a paradox of the very type you just so brilliantly indicated.

Jestin LeBaron We find ourselves only in a state of inflexibility, there are many, in fact a growing number of people, with flexible personalities, so don't lose heart.
