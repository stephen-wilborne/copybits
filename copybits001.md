Stephen Wilborne // Careful, if your logic be ambiguous you don't want to be the "boy that cried absolutely" //

Brilliant observation, Jestin LeBaron. 

But that just underscores the issue here.

The universe is indeed governed by something other than an Aristotelian logic, but human brains (at least in this current society in which i find myself) are programmed into thinking that way.

Even the attempt to answer this question with a "yes or no answer" reveals the programming!

Thus, the mere act of answering this question presents a paradox of the very type you just so brilliantly indicated.

Jestin LeBaron We find ourselves only in a state of inflexibility, there are many, in fact a growing number of people, with flexible personalities, so don't lose heart.
